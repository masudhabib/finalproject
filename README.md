# Math parser project  ( IDE : VSCODE , Python version 2.7)

1) I have created 2 python files , a) mathparser.py and b) parserevaluation.py for my Parser project.

2) parserevaluation.py file has a driver code which will evaluate function from mathparser.py file and process its result.

3) mathparser.py is main program which takes an expression as string and then it converts it to char array. It will check each char in string and check if it is a number or an operator.

4) This program supports four basic math operations, functions, parentheses, and variables.

5) In each iteration we check for white space and skip it every time. Moreover, we have an exception for input data errors.
